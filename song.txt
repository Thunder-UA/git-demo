Gonna love but I can't fight
I had my childhood stolen from me one night
So I don't care about a bruise
You think that cause I got a smile on face
That I don't know pain
We'll look into my past but I ain't goin' back again
Never again

[Chorus]
Told you I'd survive, made it out alive
And you can't touch me now
And though my mind won't be the same
It's over
Told you I'd survive, made it out alive
And you can't touch me now
And though my mind won't be the same
I'm still around
[Verse 2]
Gonna love, but I can fight
If I gotta cause I know what's inside
Trust my heart, use my head
Act with love and never hide
Even though it hurts, I wouldn't change anything
I'm grateful for each day, even with the pain it brings
I got my tomorrow

[Chorus]
Told you I'd survive, made it out alive
And you can't touch me now
And though my mind won't be the same
It's over
Told you I'd survive, made it out alive
And you can't touch me now
And though my mind won't be the same
I'm still around
Told you I'd survive, made it out alive
And you can't touch me now
And though my mind won't be the same
It's over
Told you I'd survive, made it out alive
And you can't touch me now
And though my mind won't be the same
I'm still around

[Outro]
Told you I'd survive, made it out alive
And you can't touch me now


SECOND SONG
Baby don't let me down
I got a lot goin' on right now
And I need you to Hold me
Need you to Hold me

Baby don't let me down
I got a lot goin' on right now
And I need you beside me
Need you beside me
